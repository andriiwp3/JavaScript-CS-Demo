    <h1 class="section__title">What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <h2 class="section__subtitle">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. It is the third layer of the 🍰 of web technologies <code>(HTML + CSS + JavaScript)</code></h2>

    <h1 class="section__title">Where did JS 🚶 from?</h1>
    <h2 class="section__subtitle">JavaScript is designed by Brendan Eich in December 1995, it was originally called LiveScript and was built for Netscape browser. However in November 1996, Netscape submitted JS to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997</h2>

    <h1 class="section__title">What does it give us? ✅</h1>
    <div class="horizontal-scrolling">
      <h1 class="section__title">UI interactivity 🤩</h1>
      <h2 class="section__subtitle">Since the very beginning, JS has brought UI interactivity to the web. It now does the same for applications of all kind, helping to develop the most engaging UX. And especially today, frameworks like Vue.js are bringing transitions & animations to the next level</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="horizontal-scrolling">
      <h1 class="section__title">Good responsive web design 🖥️</h1>
      <h2 class="section__subtitle">More and more, developers need to adapt their design across multiple browsers and devices. Combining HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript, they can do so within a single codebase</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="horizontal-scrolling">
      <h1 class="section__title">Client-side and hence faster UX 🚀</h1>
      <h2 class="section__subtitle">With the code running directly in the browser, the need for server calls is abstracted, hence a cut in loading times. Even with the presence of a server, the fact that JS is asynchronous means that it’s able to communicate with the server in the background without interrupting the user interaction taking place in the frontend</h2>

    <div class="horizontal-scrolling">
      <h1 class="section__title">JS is easy to learn 😌</h1>
      <h2 class="section__subtitle">For developers, JS is easy to learn and fast to get into active development. Its syntax is easy and flexible for newcomers. It also simplifies the development of complex applications by enabling developers to simplify the app’s composition</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="horizontal-scrolling">
      <h1 class="section__title">JavaScript is insanely popular 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦</h1>
      <h2 class="section__subtitle">If popularity doesn’t always equal quality in life in general, it at least mean one important thing: you’ll find the solution to any problem within the community. In web development, that’s not a negligible detail. If you’re someone that needs to hire developers, that’s also a big plus, as the pool of candidates is huge</h2>
